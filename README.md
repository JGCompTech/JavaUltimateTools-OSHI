**NOTE: This Project Has Now Been Updated To Use Java 11!!!**

**NOTE: This project used to be merged with the [JavaUltimateTools](https://github.com/JGCompTech/JavaUltimateTools) project but, to allow for ease of development process and the ability to update each section sepeately, it made sense to create seperate libraries.
This project has a dependancy on the JavaUltimateTools base library and, if using a package manager, will be auto-imported.**
